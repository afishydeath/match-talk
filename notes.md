# Notes on the match statement documentation
- The `match` keyword denotes the subject expression
  - The subject expression can have any number of variables or literals, but no expressions
- The `case` keyword denotes a pattern to match, which can take many forms.
  - `_` is the wildcard pattern, which will match anything
  - A literal will match exactly that literal
  - Any other non-keyword will create a capturing match, which stores the matching expression in that variable
  - You can "or" matches with the `|` keyword
  - You can use the `as` keyword to store the match with a capturing pattern
  - You can match on attributes with `.` accessing
  - You can match the contents of a sequence either exactly, or with star capturing patterns, or a mix of the two.
  - You can do the same with mappings, with any mix of direct matches, wildcard matches, or `**` "kwarg" capturing expressions
  - Classes can be matched against with either attribute notation or positional notation, if the class supports this.
  - MOST IMPORTANTLY, ALL OF THESE CAN BE STACKED FOR UNLIMITED POTENTIAL
